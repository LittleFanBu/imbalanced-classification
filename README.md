# imbalanced-classification
Imbalanced Classification: one of the class is relatively rare as compared with other class(es)
One of the ways to alleviate imbalanced problem is to use data-augmentation, such as flip, rotate, crop, 
and add noise) to generate the samples of the minority class of the training set, helping the model to learn 
rich representations of minority class
In this task,I implemented a deep learning model to solve an imbalanced face mask detection
Real-world applications often suffer from imbalanced problems [1], where the class of interest is relatively rare
as compared with other class(es). One of the simple yet effective methods to alleviate imbalanced problems is to
use data augmentation. In this task, I implemented a data-augmentation-based deep learning
model to solve an imbalanced face mask detection task
